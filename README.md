### Project Overview
Many online stores struggle to optimize operations due to a lack of actionable insights into inventory, sales, and customer behavior. This project tackles these challenges by leveraging SQL to answer critical business questions, from inventory management to customer segmentation. Through carefully crafted queries, I analyzed key areas like stock levels (e.g., identifying zero-stock or overstocked products), product performance (e.g., top-selling categories), customer loyalty (e.g., inactive customers), sales trends (e.g., month-over-month growth), customer acquisition (e.g., new customers per month), and detailed segmentation (e.g., by gender, age, or spending). This data-driven approach empowers businesses to prevent stockouts, target high-value customers, and craft precise marketing strategies, driving operational efficiency and revenue growth.

### Data Sources 
The database consists of three main tables: dim_customers, which stores customer details, fact_sales which tracks sales data and dim_products, which holds product information. These dimensions tables (customers and products) are joined to the fact sales table using customer_id and product_id.

### Tools used for this project

- Power Query in Excel : Data Cleaning .
- MySQL : Data Analysis.
- Excel : Visualization with simple stacked column chart, bar, line, doughnut and pie charts.

### Data Cleaning/Preparation
  In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following task:
   1. Data loading and inspection to correct data errors.
   2. Handling missing values.
   3. Standardizing data formats.
   4. Removing duplicates.
   5. Validating data integrity.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
 - Which products are out of stock or overstocked?
 - Which product categories are top seller?
 - Which customers are loyal?
 - What are the peak sales period?

### Results and Findings
 - The inventory reveals that 40% of products are overstocked, 28% maintain normal stock levels, 30% are at risk of stockout, and a mere 2% are out of stock, emphasizing the need for strategic adjustments to optimize stock distribution and prevent potential sales losses.

 - Based on the average daily sales, electronics and books are projected to be out of stock within 100 days, necessitating urgent restocking efforts for these high-demand categories. In contrast, other product categories are expected to last up to five months, allowing for more flexible inventory planning and management.

 - 80% of the store's revenue is driven by just 26 products, accounting for 52% of the total product lineup (50 products),
 with 6 standout performers (Move Plus, Bring Pro, Her Lite, Thank Lite, Voice Pro, and Compare Plus) each generating over $1 million.

 - The profit margin across each product category ranges from a solid 29% to 33%, reflecting a healthy and consistent profitability that strengthens the store's financial performance and supports future growth initiatives.
 - The categories of Home Appliances, Sports, and Electronics emerge as top performers, each generating revenue exceeding $5 million, underscoring their  significant contribution to the store's overall financial success and highlighting key areas for strategic focus and investment.
 - The top 10 products boasting an impressive profit margin of approximately 50% are predominantly from the home appliances and sports categories,
 highlighting these segments as key drivers of high profitability and potential areas for targeted expansion.
 - An impressive 86% of customers in the database have made at least one purchase, reflecting an outstanding conversion rate that showcases the store's ability to effectively turn visitors into loyal buyers, but 80% of them are inactive that means they do not make any purchases for more than 90 days.

 - The total customer acquisition rate across countries remains stable at approximately 20%, indicating a consistent and reliable growth in new customers that supports the store's ongoing expansion and market penetration efforts.
 - An overwhelming 98% of customers spend between $0 and $10,000 in the store, highlighting a broad base of low-to-mid-range spenders that underscores the need for targeted strategies to encourage higher spending among this dominant segment.
 - The primary customer base consists of adults aged 30 and older, indicating a focus on a mature demographic.

 - The analysis reveals monthly sales fluctuating between $970K and $1.4M, with notable peaks in April 2024 ($1.31M, 26.5% growth vs. previous month) and January 2025.

### Recommendations
 - Prioritize restocking electronics and books within the next 90 days to avoid stockouts, while optimizing overstocked inventory (40%) by redistributing excess stock to high-demand categories or offering promotions to clear surplus.
 - Focus marketing and inventory investment on the top-performing categories (Home Appliances, Sports, Electronics) and the 6 standout products (Move Plus, Bring Pro, Her Lite, Thank Lite, Voice Pro, Compare Plus), which drive 80% of revenue, to maximize profitability and sales.
 - Develop targeted reactivation campaigns for the 80% of inactive customers (out of the 86% who have purchased) to re-engage them, leveraging their past purchase data to encourage repeat buys and increase overall sales.
 - Introduce strategies to upsell or cross-sell to the 98% of customers spending $0-$10,000, such as bundling high-margin products from Home Appliances and Sports (50% profit margin) to boost average order value.
 - Tailor marketing and product offerings to the mature demographic (80% aged 30+), aligning seasonal promotions with peak sales periods (e.g., March and January) to capitalize on growth rates up to 25% and mitigate declines.
 - The healthy profit margin range of 29%-33% across all categories, combined with a 50% margin on top 10 products, indicates an opportunity to explore premium product lines to enhance overall profitability.
 - The consistent 20% customer acquisition rate across countries suggests a stable market expansion potential, which could be leveraged by introducing region-specific promotions to further boost growth.
